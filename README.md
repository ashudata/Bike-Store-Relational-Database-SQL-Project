Project Overview:-
This project analyzes a retail business dataset to uncover insights and trends that can help drive strategic decisions. The dataset contains information about customers, orders, products, stores, staff, and various sales metrics. By running a series of SQL queries, I aimed to identify key performance indicators and patterns across different dimensions of the business.

Objectives:-
1.Identify the top-performing brands, products, and stores in terms of sales and revenue. 
2.Determine customer and staff performance metrics. 
3.Analyze the impact of discounts on sales and order quantities. 
4.Evaluate shipping efficiency and stock management. 
5.Understand the distribution of revenue across different product categories and stores. 6.Provide actionable insights to improve sales, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

Methodology
I performed a series of SQL queries to analyze the retail business dataset. These queries aimed to identify key performance metrics, including the top-performing brands, products, and stores, as well as customer and staff performance. I also assessed the impact of discounts, shipping efficiency, and stock management. By grouping and aggregating data, I calculated total sales, order quantities, average discounts, and market shares. Additionally, I evaluated the distribution of revenue across product categories and stores, the average order frequency per customer, and the sales performance of products by model year.

Results
In my analysis, I discovered the brand with the highest total sales and identified the customer with the highest number of orders, along with their respective values. I also pinpointed the product with the highest sales volume and determined the store generating the highest revenue. Additionally, I calculated the category with the highest average discount and the percentage of orders shipped on or before the required date. I found the staff member managing the highest number of orders and identified the state with the highest number of customers and revenue. Moreover, I examined the average order frequency per customer and identified the product with the lowest stock quantity. I analyzed the revenue distribution across product categories, identified the most common city among customers, and studied the average order value across different stores. Furthermore, I evaluated the sales performance of products by model year, identified the order with the highest number of items, and calculated the market share of each brand. I listed the top 10 best-selling products, analyzed the sales contribution of each store, and examined the average orders handled by each staff member. Finally, I conducted an analysis on the impact of discounts on total sales value and order quantity.
